Rules of Go and build instructions are below.

## How to play

Although the normal size of a Go board is 19 by 19 lines, it is possible to use smaller sizes. A quick game can be played on a 13 by 13 board without losing the essential character of the game. The following examples all use a 9 by 9 board.
We recommend that beginners learn the basics on a 9 by 9 board, moving up to a 13 by 13 board after a few games and only playing on a 19 by 19 board if you can play a complete game within 15 minutes and are comfortable with some of the strategic concepts.


## The Rules

A game of Go starts with an empty board. Each player has an effectively unlimited supply of pieces (called stones), one taking the black stones, the other taking white. The main object of the game is to use your stones to form territories by surrounding vacant areas of the board. It is also possible to capture your opponent's stones by completely surrounding them.
Players take turns, placing one of their stones on a vacant point at each turn, with Black playing first. Note that stones are placed on the intersections of the lines rather than in the squares and once played stones are not moved. However they may be captured, in which case they are removed from the board, and kept by the capturing player as prisoners.

# Contribute 

If you want to contribute to the project and make it better, your help is very welcome. 
Contributing is also a great way to learn more about social coding on Github, new technologies and and their ecosystems and how to make constructive, helpful bug reports, feature requests and the noblest of all contributions: a good, clean pull request.

Once the pull request is approved and merged you can pull the changes from upstream to your local repo and delete your extra branch(es). And last but not least: Always write your commit messages in the present tense. Your commit message should describe what the commit, when applied, does to the code â€“ not what you did to the code.
